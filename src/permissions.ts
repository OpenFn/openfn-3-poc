/**
 * What a user may do, as one flat set of booleans. Pages call
 * `permissionsFor(project, user)` (or `usePermissions(project)`) once and pass
 * the booleans they need down to components, the way Lightning's views assign
 * `can_*` flags at mount and hand them to their components.
 *
 * The rules mirror Lightning's policies:
 * - Lightning.Policies.ProjectUsers (lib/lightning/policies/project_users.ex):
 *   admin actions need owner or admin, editor actions owner, admin or editor,
 *   `:delete_project` owner only.
 * - Lightning.Policies.Credentials: keychain credentials need owner or admin.
 * - Lightning.Policies.Collections `:manage_collection`: owner or admin.
 * - Lightning.Policies.Sandboxes `:provision_sandbox`: owner, admin or editor.
 * - Lightning.Policies.Users: a credential or OAuth client is edited by its owner.
 *
 * Not modelled: support users (no fixture user has `support_user`) and the
 * project MFA requirement (no fixture project sets it), which Lightning also
 * folds into these answers.
