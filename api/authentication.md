# Authentication

Apart from the token endpoints, webhooks, sign-up and a few account routes,
every endpoint takes a token. Most take a bearer token in the `Authorization`
header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Lightning accepts these kinds of token. Each endpoint section says which ones
it takes.

| Token | Who holds it | How to get one |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Personal access token | A person | Create one in the app under your user profile. It acts as that person, with their project roles. |
| Service account access token | Automation | Trade a signed assertion at `POST /api/oauth/token` (see below). It lasts five minutes and carries scopes. |
| Run token | A running job | Issued by Lightning to a run. Only used by the collections item API. |
| GitHub sync token | Lightning's GitHub integration | Created when a project is connected to a repository. Only used by provisioning, for that project. It holds one grant, `projects:provision`, which the token endpoint never issues, so any other `/api` route answers it 403 `insufficient_scope`. |
| Web app session | A person signed in to Lightning's web app | Sign in at `/users/log_in`. A cookie, not a header. Only a few routes take it today, and they take nothing else (see below). |
| Session token (planned) | A person using Lightning's own app | Sign in with `POST /api/session` (see below). Sent as a cookie, not a header. |

## The web app's session

A few Public routes serve Lightning's own web app and take its session cookie
instead of a bearer token: the AI assistant's session list and the workflow
health routes. They take no bearer token, not even a personal access token.
Without a signed-in session they answer 401 `unauthenticated` with
`WWW-Authenticate: Session realm="Lightning"`. So does a session that still
owes an MFA code, or whose email must be confirmed first. Each of these routes
says so in its own section.

## Session tokens

Planned. A session token grows the web app's session into the way Lightning's
own app signs in and calls the whole API for the person using it. The other tokens are for clients outside Lightning, and a
script holding one may not have a person behind it. A session token always
does, so it is the only kind that can sign a person in, change how they prove
who they are, or use the AI assistant.

- [`POST /api/session`](./account.md#sign-in) signs in with a password, and an
  MFA code when the account has MFA. Signing in through a provider ends with
  Lightning setting the same session.
- It is a cookie, so the browser sends it on its own, including when the app
  sends the browser through a provider's sign-in page and back. Lightning only
  accepts it on requests from its own pages, and writes also need the
  `x-csrf-token` header, from [`GET /api/session`](./account.md#get-the-session).
- It acts as the person, with their project roles, like a personal access
  token. Wherever an endpoint takes a personal access token, it takes a session
  token too.
- **Stepped up**: a few routes, such as turning off MFA, need the person to
  have entered their password or an MFA code in the last five minutes. Post it
  to `POST /api/session` again. Without it they answer 403
  `step_up_required`.
- A project that requires MFA turns away a session whose person hasn't set it
  up, as it does their other tokens.
- [`DELETE /api/session`](./account.md#sign-out) signs out. Changing a
  password, or a superuser disabling the account, ends every session.

## Service account tokens

A service account signs in with an RSA key pair instead of a password. The
instance operator sets the public key as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY`, and your
automation keeps the private key. Each instance has at most one service
account. Changing or removing the key revokes every token already issued, and
so does changing `WORKER_RUNS_PRIVATE_KEY`, which signs the access tokens.

`SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY` takes raw PEM, PEM with literal `\n`, or the PEM
file base64-encoded on one line. It must be an RSA key of at least 2048 bits. A
bad value stops Lightning at boot with a message naming the variable. While it
is set, the web app's first setup page is turned off, so the first superuser
comes from [`POST /api/users`](./users.md).

If `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY` isn't set, the instance has no service account.
The token endpoint still answers, and refuses every assertion with 401
`invalid_client`, the same answer as for a wrong `iss`.

The service account isn't a user. It can't own credentials, so `POST` and
`DELETE /api/credentials` answer it 403 `forbidden`. It can't provision through
`POST /api/provision`, and it can't use the `/collections` item API that jobs
read and write. It is the only caller `/api/users` accepts.

### Discover the token endpoint

Status: **Public**

```
GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

Returns RFC 8414 metadata. Use its `token_endpoint` value exactly as given,
because it is also the `aud` of your assertion.

### Request a token

Status: **Public**

```
POST /api/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

This is the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant with `private_key_jwt` client
authentication ([RFC 7523](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523#section-2.2)).
The body must be form encoded. JSON is refused.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `grant_type` | `client_credentials` |
| `client_assertion_type` | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer` |
| `client_assertion` | A JWT signed with RS256 by the private key |
| `scope` | Space-separated scopes, as one value. Required: a request with no `scope` is refused. |
| `client_id` | Optional. If sent, it must be the service account's id. |

The assertion's claims:

| Claim | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `iss`, `sub` | Both the service account's id: the public key's RFC 7638 thumbprint. Write `e`, `kty` and `n` as JSON in that order with no spaces, hash with SHA-256, then base64url encode. |
| `aud` | The `token_endpoint` from the metadata document, exactly. |
| `iat` | Now, as an integer in seconds. At most five seconds ahead of Lightning's clock. |
| `exp` | An integer, at most 60 seconds after `iat`. |
| `jti` | 1 to 255 bytes with no NUL character, new for every assertion. Once Lightning issues a token for a `jti` it refuses that `jti` again. An assertion it refuses doesn't use up its `jti`. |

The header's `alg` must be `RS256`.

A successful response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "scope": "projects:write credentials:write collections:write"
}
```

The response is sent with `Cache-Control: no-store`. There is no refresh
token. Sign a new assertion when you need a new token.
Each token issued records a `token_issued` audit event with the scopes it
carries.

An expired access token answers 401 `invalid_token` with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The access token expired"`.
Any other bad token gets `Bearer error="invalid_token"` with no description.

Failures follow OAuth's error format,
`{"error": "<code>", "error_description": "<why>"}`, rather than the problem
documents the rest of the API uses, whatever `Accept` says.
`error_description` says what to fix, so a client can show it. A 401 from the
token endpoint has no `WWW-Authenticate` header.

Lightning checks a token request in this order, and the first check that fails
answers: the body is form encoded, `grant_type`, the assertion's type and
presence, `scope`, then the assertion itself. So a request with a bad `scope`
and a bad assertion hears `invalid_scope`.

| Status | `error` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | The body isn't form encoded or can't be parsed; `grant_type` is missing, isn't a single value or is in the query string; `client_assertion_type` isn't the JWT bearer type or `client_assertion` is missing; or `scope` isn't a single value. |
| 413 | `invalid_request` | The body is too large. |
| 400 | `unsupported_grant_type` | `grant_type` isn't `client_credentials`. |
| 400 | `invalid_scope` | `scope` is missing or empty, or names a scope the token endpoint doesn't issue (`projects:provision` included). |
| 401 | `invalid_client` | The assertion was refused: not a JWT, wrong `iss`, `sub`, `aud` or `client_id`, a bad signature, missing or bad `exp`, `iat` or `jti`, expired, living longer than 60 seconds, issued in the future, or a `jti` used before. `error_description` says which. |

### Node.js example

No extra packages needed:

```js
import { createHash, createPrivateKey, createPublicKey, randomUUID, sign } from 'node:crypto';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

const lightning = 'https://lightning.example.org';
const key = createPrivateKey(readFileSync('service-account.key'));

const { token_endpoint } = await fetch(
  `${lightning}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
).then(r => r.json());

const { e, kty, n } = createPublicKey(key).export({ format: 'jwk' });
const id = createHash('sha256').update(JSON.stringify({ e, kty, n })).digest('base64url');

const encode = v => Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(v)).toString('base64url');
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
const unsigned = `${encode({ alg: 'RS256' })}.${encode({
  iss: id, sub: id, aud: token_endpoint, iat: now, exp: now + 60, jti: randomUUID(),
})}`;
const signature = sign('sha256', Buffer.from(unsigned), key).toString('base64url');

const { access_token } = await fetch(token_endpoint, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    grant_type: 'client_credentials',
    client_assertion_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer',
    client_assertion: `${unsigned}.${signature}`,
    scope: 'projects:write credentials:write collections:write',
  }),
}).then(r => r.json());
```

## Scopes

Lightning's own docs call these token grants. A service account token can
only do what its scopes allow. Within those scopes it acts on every project as
if it held every role, but it never appears as a project member.

| Scope | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| `users:read` | Listing and reading users |
| `users:write` | Creating and changing users, superusers included. It doesn't include `users:read`. |
| `projects:write` | Reading, creating and changing projects, and reading what's in them: workflows, jobs, work orders, runs and log lines. Also creating and changing workflows. |
| `credentials:write` | Reading, creating and replacing credentials, and which projects they're linked to |
| `collections:write` | Reading, creating and renaming collections |

Projects, credentials and collections have no read scopes. Their `GET` routes
need the same `:write` scope as their `PUT` routes.

A token without the scope a route needs answers 403 `insufficient_scope`
before Lightning looks for the record, so the answer is the same whether or not
it exists. The body's `scope` and the `WWW-Authenticate` header both name it.

Planned: an `audit:read` scope, for [audit events](./audit-events.md). Planned
endpoints on projects, credentials and collections use the scopes above.

## Single sign-on provider

An instance can let people sign in through one OpenID Connect provider, as well
as with a password. These routes set it up. The client secret is never
returned.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "keycloak",
    "discovery_url": "https://sso.example.org/realms/main/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "client_id": "lightning",
    "redirect_uri": "https://lightning.example.org/authenticate/keycloak/callback",
    "inserted_at": "…",
    "updated_at": "…"
  }
}
```

`redirect_uri` is where the provider sends people back, worked out from the
`name`. Register it with the provider.

### Get the sign-in provider

Status: **Private**

```
GET /api/auth_provider
```

Tokens: personal access token of a superuser. Answers 404 `not_found` when
none is set up.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.AuthProviders.get_existing/0`, which the
> superuser page at `/settings/authentication`
> (`LightningWeb.AuthProvidersLive.Index`) loads on mount. Differences: it
> returns the stored `client_secret`, which the route must leave out, and an
> `allow_unverified_email` flag the spec doesn't show. It does no authorisation
> check; the page relies on the `:ensure_admin` hook.

### Set the sign-in provider

Status: **Private**

```
PUT /api/auth_provider
```

Tokens: personal access token of a superuser.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required. Lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Part of `redirect_uri`. |
| `discovery_url` | string | Required. An HTTPS URL. |
| `client_id` | string | Required. |
| `client_secret` | string | Required when setting up. Leave it out to keep the stored one. |

Lightning fetches the discovery document before it saves, and the new settings
apply to the next sign-in. Answers 201 when it sets one up and 200 when it
replaces one. A discovery document that can't be fetched, or has no
authorization or token endpoint, answers 422 `invalid` with a
`discovery_failed` entry at `#/discovery_url`.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.AuthProviders.create/1` and
> `Lightning.AuthProviders.update/2`, through the form's `save` event in
> `LightningWeb.AuthProvidersLive.FormComponent`. Differences:
>
> - the name and URL format checks, and building `redirect_uri`, are in
>   `Lightning.AuthProviders.AuthConfigForm.change/2`, not the schema
>   changeset. `create/1` and `update/2` only check required fields, so the
>   route has to run the form changeset first.
> - saving doesn't fetch the discovery document. Only the page's `test` event
>   does, through `AuthConfigForm.validate_provider/1`, and it also refuses a
>   plain HTTP URL. The route has to call it before saving. The page's Test
>   button checks the unsaved form, new or existing, without saving it, and
>   saving doesn't wait for a passing test. This route has no way to check
>   without saving.
> - the page builds `redirect_uri` from a redirect host the user can edit. The
>   route should use the instance's own URL.
> - `update/2` refreshes the cached sign-in handler, but under the new name
>   only, so a rename leaves the old one cached for up to 30 minutes.
>   `create/1` caches nothing; the handler is built on first use.
> - there's an `allow_unverified_email` flag the spec doesn't have.
> - it takes no actor and records no audit event.

### Remove the sign-in provider

Status: **Private**

```
DELETE /api/auth_provider
```

Tokens: personal access token of a superuser.

Turns off single sign-on at once. Answers 204 with no body.

> Implementation note: `Lightning.AuthProviders.remove_handler/1` then
> `Lightning.AuthProviders.delete!/1`, through the form's `disable` event.
> Differences: `delete!/1` takes the record and raises on failure, so the route
> has to look it up with `get_existing/0` and answer 404 itself. It takes no
> actor and records no audit event.
