# Errors

Every error from the API (except the token endpoint, see [Authentication](./authentication.md)) is an
[RFC 9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) problem document:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "status": 400,
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "code": "invalid_parameter",
  "detail": "A path or query parameter is not valid. See errors.",
  "errors": [{ "path": "id", "code": "type", "detail": "is not a UUID" }]
}
```

- Branch on `code`. It is stable, and each code always comes with the same
  status (except `exceeds_limit`, which webhooks send as 429). `title` and
  `detail` are for people and may change.
- `errors` appears only when the problem lies in particular parts of the
  request. Each entry has a `code`, a `detail` and exactly one location:
  `pointer` (a JSON pointer into the body, such as `#/members/0/email`),
  `parameter` (a query parameter's name), `header` (a request header's name, in
  lower case) or `path` (a path segment, named as in the route, such as `id` or
  `project_id`). Entries never quote a value you sent.
- The content type is `application/problem+json` when your `Accept` header
  names it, and `application/json` otherwise. The body is the same either way.
- Some problems carry extra members: `scope` on 403 `insufficient_scope`, and
  `work_order_id` on a synchronous webhook's errors once a work order exists.

## Order of checks

Lightning checks a request in a fixed order, and the first check that fails
answers. A body that can't be read at all (invalid JSON as 400 `malformed`, 413
or 415) is refused before any of these.

1. Authentication. A missing or bad token is 401, or 400 `invalid_request` for
   an `Authorization` header Lightning can't read.
2. Scope. A token without the scope the route needs is 403
   `insufficient_scope`, even if the id doesn't exist or the body is wrong.
3. Permission. If you may not do this to the project or record, it is 403
   `forbidden`, whether or not the record exists and whether or not the id is a
   UUID.
4. Project state. A project in the path that is scheduled for deletion is 409
   `scheduled_for_deletion`, whether or not the record under it exists.
5. The id. 400 `invalid_parameter` with a `path` entry if it isn't a UUID, 404
   `not_found` if no such record exists. A record in another project counts as
   missing.
6. Record state. A record that is itself scheduled for deletion is 409
   `scheduled_for_deletion`. An id held by a record at another URL is 409
   `id_taken`.
7. Parameters and body. A bad query parameter or header, or a body that isn't a
   JSON object, is 400. Then 503 `not_ready` if Lightning can't answer yet.
   Then every other problem with the body is reported together in one 422
   `invalid`. `concurrent_edit` comes only from the write, so a 422 beats it.
8. Plan limits. 402 `exceeds_limit` (429 on webhooks), asked only of a request
   that is otherwise valid.

A viewer's `PATCH` on a missing workflow is therefore 403, while their `GET` on
it is 404.

### Who hears 404

Only a caller who may learn which records exist hears 404 or 400 for an id.
Everyone else hears 403 `forbidden`.

| The id names | 404 and 400 go to |
| --- | --- |
| A record under `/api/projects/:project_id/` | Anyone with permission on the project |
| A project | Superusers and the service account |
| A workflow, job, run or work order at the top level | The service account |
| A credential, to read it | The service account |
| A user | The service account |

## Response codes

| Status | `code` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `bad_request` | The request could not be read. |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | The `Authorization` header is malformed: nothing after `Bearer`, whitespace inside the token, or the header sent twice. |
| 400 | `malformed` | The body is not valid JSON, or not a JSON object. |
| 400 | `invalid_parameter` | A path or query parameter is not valid, such as an id that isn't a UUID. `errors` names each one. |
| 400 | `invalid_header` | A request header is not valid. |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` | No credentials: no bearer token (an `Authorization` header with another scheme, such as `Basic`, counts as none), no signed-in session on a route that takes the web app's session, or a webhook's credentials refused. |
| 401 | `invalid_token` | The token is expired or bad, or this route doesn't accept its kind. |
| 401 | `invalid_credentials` | Planned. Signing in failed. The same for every reason, so it can't be used to find accounts. |
| 401 | `mfa_required` | Planned. Signing in needs an MFA code too. |
| 402 | `exceeds_limit` | This would exceed a limit of your plan. |
| 403 | `forbidden` | You may not do this, or it might not exist. Also sent when the project requires MFA you haven't set up, and to a token kind the route isn't open to. |
| 403 | `insufficient_scope` | The token lacks the scope this route needs. `scope` in the body names it. |
| 403 | `step_up_required` | Planned. The person must enter their password or an MFA code again first. See [session tokens](./authentication.md#session-tokens). |
| 403 | `trigger_disabled` | The webhook's trigger is disabled. |
| 404 | `not_found` | The record doesn't exist, or the route doesn't. Only sent to a caller who may learn which records exist. |
| 406 | `not_acceptable` | The resource can't be returned in the format you asked for. |
| 408 | `request_timeout` | The request body did not arrive in time. Listed in Lightning's codes, but its web server doesn't send it today. |
| 409 | `scheduled_for_deletion` | The project or credential is scheduled for deletion. |
| 409 | `id_taken` | The id belongs to a record elsewhere, such as another project's collection. |
| 409 | `being_edited` | The workflow is open in the editor. |
| 409 | `concurrent_edit` | Another request changed or deleted this record. Fetch it again and retry. |
| 409 | `in_use` | The credential has been used by runs and can't be deleted. |
| 409 | `ambiguous_name` | More than one collection has this name. Add `project_id`. |
| 409 | `export_conflict` | Two items in this project export under the same key. Listed in Lightning's codes but not sent yet: today a clash on `GET /api/provision/yaml` falls through to a 500. |
| 413 | `content_too_large` | The body is too large. |
| 414 | `uri_too_long` | The query string is too long. |
| 415 | `unsupported_media_type` | The body must be JSON. |
| 422 | `invalid` | The body is not valid. `errors` lists every problem. |
| 429 | `too_many_runs` | Too many runs. Try again later. |
| 429 | `too_many_requests` | Too many requests. Try again later. |
| 500 | `internal` | Something went wrong in Lightning. |
| 501 | `not_implemented` | Not available on this instance. |
| 502 | `bad_gateway` | The channel could not reach its destination. |
| 503 | `service_unavailable` | Try again shortly. |
| 503 | `not_ready` | Not ready yet. Sent with `Retry-After`. |
| 504 | `timeout` | A synchronous webhook's workflow did not finish in time. |

A value that must be unique and is already in use is a 422 `invalid` with a
`taken` entry pointing at it, never a 409.

Every 401 carries a `WWW-Authenticate` header, except the token endpoint's and
a webhook's that takes only Basic auth. A route that takes a bearer token sends
`Bearer`, one that takes the web app's session sends
`Session realm="Lightning"`, and a webhook that takes an API key sends
`ApiKey header="x-api-key"`. A 400 `invalid_request` carries
`Bearer error="invalid_request"`. An expired service account token says so in
it:
`error_description="The access token expired"`. A 403 `insufficient_scope`
carries one naming the scope you need, for example
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", scope="credentials:write"`.

## Entry codes

Codes that can appear on an entry in `errors`:

`already_scheduled`, `credential_not_allowed`, `cycle`, `dataclip_wiped`,
`deleting`, `discovery_failed`, `duplicate`, `exceeds_limit`, `exclusive`,
`format`, `invalid`, `missing_trigger_edge`, `mismatch`, `must_accept`,
`no_access`, `not_allowed`, `not_found`, `not_supported`, `one_body`,
`one_admin`, `one_enabled`, `one_enabled_edge`, `one_owner`, `out_of_range`, `required`,
`reserved`, `scope_not_granted`, `single_target`, `storage_failed`, `taken`,
`too_long`, `too_many_secrets`, `too_short`, `tree_branch_conflict`,
`trigger_removed`, `type`, `unchanged`, `unknown_key`, `wrong_length`.

Response codes and entry codes are part of the API contract, listed in
`LightningWeb.API.Codes`. Adding one is compatible. Renaming or removing one, or
moving it to another status, is a breaking change.

## Unknown routes

Any path under `/api` or `/collections` that doesn't exist answers a 404
`not_found` problem document, before authentication. The problem document's
content type follows `Accept` here too. The exception is a path under
`/api/oauth/token`, such as a `GET` on the token endpoint, which gets a plain
404 that isn't a problem document.
