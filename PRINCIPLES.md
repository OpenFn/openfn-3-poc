# Design system principles

## What good looks like

**Why.** The design system makes the frontend look and feel consistent,
with defined patterns shared across screens. It moves us to a cleaner
frontend with less styling debt than Lightning has today. Without defined
patterns, building with AI gets messy, as the collab editor did.

**Lightning.** Same words and behaviour as Lightning, with one consistent
look. Where Lightning harms the user (it's inaccessible, hides why something
failed, or loses work) and the fix lives in a shared part, we fix it and
write it down in [docs/lightning-differences.md](./docs/lightning-differences.md).

**Tokens.** Anything common comes from tokens, never raw values. Colour
and type do, and lint enforces it. Spacing and radius should too; they
aren't checked yet.

**Colour comes from roles, and is easy to change.** A role is a token named
for a job (`text-muted`, `bg-surface`, `bg-danger`). Components use
roles, never a palette shade (`gray-600`, `red-100`) or a hex. Only
`src/theme/` touches the palette, to give each role its value. A theme
sets role values and never changes the palette, so gray-600 is the same grey
everywhere. One role does one job, so changing how one thing looks is one
edit. The rules are in [docs/colour.md](./docs/colour.md).

**Where things go.** Search first, and say what you found. Something other
design systems have is a primitive. Something Lightning-specific that two
screens use is domain. A one-off gets its own small file in the area folder,
never written inline in a page.

**Debt.** `debt:` is never used in new work: code that can't pass lint isn't
finished. It only freezes old code when a new rule lands, with a human's yes.

**How we know it works.** The numbers go down, below today's. Agents given
a new screen get it right first time. The screens look like one product. And
the structure is easy to explain to a developer.

Organise first, then improve the look: once pages hold no styling, a better
look is a change to the primitives. General web and accessibility rules are
Vercel's [web interface guidelines](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines);
where they clash with Lightning's wording, Lightning wins. How to apply all
this is in [docs/building.md](./docs/building.md).

## Components

- One job, one component. When two do the same thing, delete one.
- Name it for its job, never its look or the page it was first used on: a
  name holding a colour, size or page name gets renamed (`RedModal` →
  `ConfirmModal`, `HistoryPill` → `RunStatePill`).
- Compose, don't configure: content through `children` and named slots
  (`title`, `footer`), not boolean props that change what it does.
- A prop that changes the look is one `variant`, not a boolean; `can*`
  permissions and states (`disabled`, `pending`) stay booleans.
- Primitives know nothing about Lightning: no product wording, permissions
  or sandbox logic.
- `className` on a primitive is layout and sizing only (`flex-1`, `w-full`,
  `min-w-0`), never for how it looks. The list is in src/components/CLAUDE.md.
- The parent owns the space between children. No outer margins.
- A component's stories are its spec: one per state (empty, loading, error,
  disabled, pending, long text).

## Look and behaviour

- Colour means something: red is an error or a destructive action, yellow a
  warning, green success, blue information, orange a crash. A run state
  takes its tone's colour, the same in every place it's drawn. If taking the
  colour away loses nothing, it's grey.
- Contrast 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text and icons. Colour is never the
  only signal.
- A control the user is blocked from (by permission, plan or state) stays
  focusable and its tooltip says why ("Only owners can delete projects").
  Native `disabled` only when there's nothing to explain.
- Text a user typed has a known home. In a one-line slot (table cell,
  breadcrumb, pill, tab, menu item, button) it truncates and shows the whole
  value on hover, through `Td truncate` or `Truncated`, never by hand. In a
  block (heading, detail list, description, toast) it wraps, breaking long
  words and URLs. Every story with user text has a Long variant.
- Every list has an empty state. Every action has pending and error states.
- Success messages fade; errors stay until dismissed and say what to do.

## One way to do each thing

- **Page:** breadcrumb, title, main action on the right, tabs, content.
- **Switch or checkbox:** a switch takes effect now; a checkbox is part of a
  form you submit. The workflow editor's on/off settings stay switches,
  because the editor is one draft saved as a whole.
- **Status:** one badge per kind of status, same words and colours
  everywhere.
- **Row actions:** up to two quiet buttons, the rest in one menu.
- **Confirm:** one dialog that names the thing. Delete goes last in the
  menu, in red.
- **Loading:** a placeholder for content, a spinner inside the button for
  actions, one full-screen loader.
- **Icon button:** always a label and a tooltip.

## Forms

A form is four blocks: a container (card, pop-up or sign-in card), a `Form`,
a `Field` per question, and the control. A page fills them in and never lays
out labels, errors or buttons itself.

- One order: label, hint, control, error.
- The label row: label, required star and info icon on the left; at most one
  link or badge on the right. Explain a choice in the hint, not an info icon.
- Every control has a name, visible or `aria-label`.
- Radios or checkboxes that answer one question sit under one label as a
  group.
- One look for every control, one red for errors.
- Errors show when you leave a field or press Save, never while typing. The
  browser's own bubbles are off.
- Never disable Save for invalid values. Show the errors on Save and focus
  the first.
- Buttons on the right, main action last. The sign-in card's single button
  runs the full width.
- A search box or the AI chat box isn't a form; its button sits in the box.

## How data flows

A page only shows what it's given (props). That way the same page works inside today's Lightning and in the new app. Fetching and saving happen in a small file beside each page, the wrapper and never in the page itself. 

- **Loading.** The route calls one hook per kind of data, from
  `src/api/<resource>.ts` (`useTokens()`), and those hooks hold TanStack
  Query. The route never calls TanStack Query itself; the page never fetches,
  and never imports `src/api/`.
- **Saving.** After a save, the resource's hook marks the affected queries
  stale, and the page's `on*` promise resolves once they've reloaded, the way
  LiveView re-renders after an event. Never write a response into the cache.
  Show a change before the server confirms it only where the page already
  does (`useChosenValue`).
- **Waiting and refusals.** While data loads, or when the server
  refuses the whole page, the page gets an optional `status` prop, and
  `AsyncBoundary` shows it in Lightning's words. A failed save stays in its
  form. A failed action with no form shows its error in a toast that stays
  until dismissed. A crash shows an error page with "Try again". The API
  code never shows a toast; the page decides where a message goes.
- **The API code.** One `src/api/` folder: `client.ts` talks to
  Lightning (or the fake server in `src/fake-api/`) and turns refusals into `ApiError`, and one file
  per resource holds the API's shape, the mapper to page props, the query keys,
  the queries and the saves. Show the server's `detail`; branch on `code`.

How to apply it is in `.claude/rules/api.md`.

## Where we're heading

These change how Lightning looks or what it says. They apply to anything
Lightning doesn't have (a new page, action or flow) and to any page being
redesigned on purpose. Everywhere else, copy Lightning until that page's
redesign. Each one is listed in
[docs/lightning-differences.md](./docs/lightning-differences.md) when it
lands, and a listed redesign overrides an annotation's `preserve`.

- Row actions beyond two go in a ••• menu, not one labelled "Actions".
- A confirm button repeats the action ("Remove collaborator"), never
  "Confirm".
- Choose the container by the size of the task: a menu to pick, a side
  panel to edit what's selected, a pop-up for one short task, a step-by-step
  pop-up for set-up, a page for anything long. A pop-up never opens another.
- Type the name to delete a project or account.
- Step-by-step pop-ups show "Step 1 of 2", keep their size, Back left, Next
  right.
- Lists show 25 rows a page. Ported pages keep Lightning's 10 until then.
- Sentence case. Buttons are a verb and a noun. One word per thing, from a
  shared glossary.
- One primary action per screen.
